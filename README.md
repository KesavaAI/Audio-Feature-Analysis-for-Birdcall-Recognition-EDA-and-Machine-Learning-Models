# Audio-Feature-Analysis-for-Birdcall-Recognition-EDA-and-Machine-Learning-Models
This project delves into the domain of bioacoustics, focusing on birdcall recognition through extensive audio feature analysis. The objective is to leverage exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML) models to identify and classify bird species based on their vocalizations.
